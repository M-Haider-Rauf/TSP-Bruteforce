# TSP-Bruteforce
A program to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Bruteforce, one of the most extensively studied problems in CS.
Please note I have VSync enabled, so the FPS is locked with respect to refresh rate of your display (usually 60Hz).
Hence, it can only analyze 60 combinations per second. You can disable vSync by commenting out one line of code.
